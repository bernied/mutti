    -five-right-hi is 5/8 tricks, run goes right and ace is hi
  -The player with the highest bid wins and the direction of the run is set by their bid (1L or 1R)
  -If two players have the same bid but opposing directions then the third player chooses the winning bid (1L or 1R)
  -If two players have the same bid and the same direction, then (2L or 2R)
    -they play against each to determine the winner
    -3rd player attempts to win by making both lose

-Winning Tricks
  -There are 3 suits in the game: clubs (green), hearts (red) and diamonds (blue). (Should use 4 color deck.)
  -The bid winner plays the first card
  -A player must follow suit if they can
  -If a player can not follow suit they can play any card in their hand
  -Jacks are trump and will beat any card: Jack clubs > Jack hearts > Jack diamonds
  -Players do not need to play jacks on jack, but they do need to follow suit
  -The winner of the trick depends on the suit lead, the card played and the direction of the run
    -A card is higher then another card when it...
